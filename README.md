## Overview

This project is a solution to the Blog Preview Card challenge on Frontend Mentor.  
The goal of the challenge was to build a responsive blog preview card component that matches the given design.

The card includes hover and focus states, making it interactive and accessible.  
This project helped me practice layout techniques, responsive design, and using CSS variables for consistent styling.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
